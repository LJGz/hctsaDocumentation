## Installing the *hctsa* code package

The *hctsa* package should be set up by running the `install` script, which sets up a *mySQL* server and database, populates the database with our standard library of functions and operations, and then compiles all of the mex functions required by Matlab to run all of the operations.

A summary of the steps involved in setting up the system is as follows, and will be elaborated on below:

1. Install and set up a *mySQL* server, setup a new database to store Matlab calculations in, and set up Matlab to be able to communicate with it, [here](#sec:SettingUp).
2. Populate the database with master operations, operations, and time series (using the `install` script followed by the user importing their own time series using `SQL_add`), [here](sec:PopulatingDatabase).
3. Run computations to evaluate the operations on all the time series using the `sample_runscript` as a template, [here](sec:calculating).
4. Analyze the results of computations by retrieving calculated data using `TSQ_prepared`, normalizing and filtering it using `TSQ_normalize`, and then making use of a range of analysis and visualization scripts provided, [here](sec:analyzing).

## Setting up
<!--{#sec:SettingUp}-->

This section describes initial tasks that one must perform once, to set up the *mySQL* database and its interface with Matlab.

### Creating the database structure
<!--{#sec:DatabaseStructure}-->

The mySQL database contains four main components:

1. A lists of all the filenames and other metadata of time series (the **TimeSeries** table),
2. A list of all the names and other metadata of pieces of time-series analysis operations (the **Operations** table),
3. A list of all the pieces of code that must be evaluated to give each operation a value, which is necessary, for example, when one piece of code produces multiple outputs (the **MasterOperations** table), and
4. A list of the results of applying operations to time series in the database (the **Results** table). There are some additional subtleties relating to managing keywords, etc., but these basic components form the core of the database.

Time series and operations have their own tables that contain metadata associated with each piece of data, and each operation, and the results of applying each method to each time series is in the **Results** table, that has a row for every combination of time series and operation, where we also record calculation times and the quality of outputs (for cases where there the output of the operation was not a real number, or when some error occurred in the computation).
Note that while the time-series data *is* stored on the database, the executable time-series analysis code
files are not such that all code files must be in Matlab’s path (all paths can be set by running **startup.m**, explained [here](#sec:SettingThePath).

Another handy (but dangerous) function to know about is `SQL_reset`, which will **delete all data** in the mySQL database, create all the new tables, and then fill the database with all the time-series analysis operations.
The **TimeSeries**, **Operations**, and **MasterOperations** tables can be generated by running the code `SQL_create_all_tables`, with master operations and operations added to the database using SQL_add commands (described [here](sec:populating_database)).

You now you have the basic table structure set up in the database and have done the first bits of mySQL manipulation through the Matlab interface.

It is very useful to be able to inspect the database directly, using a graphical interface.
A very good example for Mac is the excellent, free application, [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com).
Similar applications exist for Windows and Linux platforms.
We encourage the user to explore the structure of these tables.
It is NOT advisable to manipulate the database directly; instead Matlab scripts should be used to interact with the database to ensure that the relationships between the different tables are maintained.

### Setting the path
<!-- {#sec:settingPath} -->

A useful way to keeping track with the directories you need to add to Matlab’s path involves creating a `.m` file containing `addpath` commands that can be run at the start of each Matlab session.
We used this to keep track of the code for operations, for analysis, third-party toolboxes, and time-series data files, which could be easily altered at any point.
An example is given in the code accompanying this document, as `startup.m`.

### Setting up an ssh tunnel to a mySQL server
<!-- {#sec:sqlssh} -->

In some cases, the mySQL server you wish to connect to requires an ssh tunnel.
One solution is to use port forwarding from your local machine to the server.
The port forward can be set up in the terminal using a command like:

    ssh -L 1234:localhost:3306 myUsername@myServer.edu

This command connects port 1234 on your local computer to port 3306 (the default mySQL port) on the server.
Now, telling Matlab to connect to `localhost` through port 1234 will connect it, through the established ssh tunnel, to the server.
This can be achieved by specifying the server as `localhost` and the port number as 1234 in the `sql_settings.conf` file (or during the `install` process).

### Maintaining the database
<!-- {#sec:maintainingDatabase} -->

In this section we describe how keywords and other types of metadata stored in the database can be manipulated, and how results of whole sets of operations and time series can be cleared or completely deleted from the database.
These tasks are implemented as Matlab functions, and ensure that key database structures are maintained. Instead performing such tasks by acting directly on the database can cause inconsistencies and should be avoided.

## Error handling {#sec:error_handling}

### Java heap space

Running out of java heap space throws the error `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError`, and usually happens when trying to retrieve a large set of time series/operations from the database.
Matlab needs to keep the whole retrieval in memory, and has a hard limit on this.
The java heap size can be increased in the Matlab preferences, under *General* $$\rightarrow$$ *Java Heap
Memory*.
