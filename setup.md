# Getting started

At the start of any analysis using the *hctsa* package, required directories must be added to the *Matlab* path using the `startup.m` script.
This function keeps track of functions for operations, for analysis, third-party toolboxes, and time-series data files, which could be easily altered at any point.

## Quick start: Installing the *hctsa* code package

The *hctsa* package requires some preliminary set up to work with a *mySQL* database, described [here](mysql_database.md):

1. Installation of *mySQL*, either locally, or on an accessible server.
2. Setting up Matlab with a *mySQL* java connector (done by running the `install_jconnector` script in the **Database** directory and then restarting Matlab).

After the database is set up, the rest of the package can be installed by running the `install.m` script, which:

1. [if required] Sets up Matlab to be able to communicate with the *mySQL* server and creates a new database to store Matlab calculations in, described [here](mysql_database.md).
2. Populates the database with our default library of master operations and operations (using `SQL_add` commands), described [here](populating.md).
3. Compiles **mex** binaries required to evaluate all operations, described [here](compiling_binaries.md). In addition to the mex files compiled by the `install` script, the user is additionally required to compile the *TISEAN* binaries if desired [in the commandline](compiling_binaries.md).

This section contains additional details about each of these steps.

Note that the above steps are one-off installation steps; once the software is installed and compiled, a typical workflow will simply involve opening Matlab, running the `startup.m` script (which adds all paths required for the *hctsa* software), and then working from any desired directory. 

Once installed, if using our default library of operations, the typical next step is to [add a dataset of time series](adding_time_series.md) using the `SQL_add` command, described.
Custom [master operations](adding_master_operations.md) and [operations](adding_operations.md) can also be added, if required.

## Next steps: computation, processing, and analysis

After installing the software and importing a time-series dataset to a *mySQL* database, the process by which data is retrieved from the database (using `SQL_retrieve`), feature sets computed (using `TS_compute`), and data stored back in the database (`SQL_store`) is described in detail [here](calculating.md).

Once a desired set of features has been computed for a time-series dataset, a range of processing, analysis, and plotting functions are also provided with the software, as described [here](analyzing_visualizing.md).
