# Computing operations on time series and writing back to the database

After retrieving data from the *mySQL* database, missing entries (NULL in the database, and NaN in the local Matlab file) can be computed using `TSQ_brawn`, and stored back to the database using `TSQ_agglomerate`.
These functions are described below.

## Performing calculations using `TSQ_brawn`
<!--{#sec:performing_calculations}-->

Once a relevant section of the data matrix has been retrieved, we can calculate values that have not previously been calculated, indicated by NULL entries in the **Results** table of the database, and NaN entries in the corresponding `HCTSA_loc.mat`.

Calculations are performed using the function `TSQ_brawn`, which stores results back into the matrices in `HCTSA_loc`.
This function can be run without inputs:

        TSQ_brawn;

Inputs to the function are optional and can be used to specify:

1. Whether to log to file or the screen (‘doLog’, default: no), and
2. Whether to compute operations across available cores using Matlab's Parallel Processing Toolbox (‘doParallel’, default: no).

Running `TSQ_brawn` will begin running operations on time series in **HCTSA_loc.mat** for which elements in **TS\_DataMat** are **NaN**s (indicating that they have not been run before) or have a [quality label](retrieving_to_compute.md) of 1 (indicating a prior error).
The results will be stored back in the matrices of **HCTSA_loc.mat**, i.e., **TS\_DataMat** (output of each operation on each time series), **TS\_CalcTime** (calculation time for each operation on each time series), and **TS\_Quality** (labels indicating errors or special-valued outputs).

When all NULL entries in **TS\_DataMat** have been calculated, **TSQ_brawn** saves the results back to the local file: **HCTSA_loc.mat**.
These results can then be inspected directly (if needed), or simply written back to the database using `TSQ_agglomerate`, as described below.

## Writing calculations back to the database using `TSQ_agglomerate`
<!--{#sec:writingCalcsDatabase}-->

Once calculations have been performed using Matlab on local files, the results must be written back to the database.
This task is performed by `TSQ_agglomerate`, which reads the data in `HCTSA_loc.mat`, checks that the metadata still matches the database, and then begins updating the **Output**, **Quality**, and **CalculationTime** columns of the **Results** table in the *mySQL* database.
This can be done by simply running:

        TSQ_agglomerate;

Depending on database latencies, this can be a relatively slow process, up to 20-25 s per time series, updating each row in the **Results** table individually using *mySQL* **UPDATE** statements.
However, the delay in this step means that the computation can be distributed across multiple compute nodes, and that stored data can be indexed and retrieved systematically.
