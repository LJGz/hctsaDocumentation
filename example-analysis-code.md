# Example analysis code

Sometimes it's easiest to quickly get going when you can follow on to some example code.
Here are some repositories that allow you to do just this.

### Flies in a tube

You can play with _hctsa_ using this [fly movement dataset and analysis code](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa_phenotypingFly).
This repository allows you to skip the process of running an _hctsa_ calculation (you can download precomputed results), and get straight down to following some analyses, including code for classifying recordings during the day versus night, or from males versus females using time-series feature extraction.

### Worms in a dish
You can try your hand at classifying different strains of the nematode worm _C. elegans_ based on their time series of their movement speed.
The repository, with links to precomputed `HCTSA.mat` files, is [here](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa_phenotypingWorm).
