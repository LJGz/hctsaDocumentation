# Computation time

The scaling of the time taken to compute 7749 features of v0.93 of _hctsa_ is shown below. The figure compares results using a single core (e.g., `TS_compute(false)`) to results using a 16-core machine, with parallelization enabled (e.g., `TS_compute(true)`).

## Computing approaches
Depending on the size of the dataset, whether it may grow in the future, and the computational resources available, a different computing approach may be selected.

1. For small datasets, when it is feasible to run all computations in a single go, it is easiest to run computations within Matlab in a single call of `TS_compute`.
2. For larger datasets that may run for a long time on a single machine, one may wish to use something like the provided `sample_runscript_matlab` script, where `TS_compute` commands are run in a loop over time series, saving results back to file (`HCTSA.mat`) at prescribed increments.
