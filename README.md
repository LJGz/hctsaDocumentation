# Introduction

This manual outlines the steps required to set up and implement highly comparative time-series analysis using the [hctsa package](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa), as described in our papers:

1. B.D. Fulcher and N.S. Jones. [_hctsa_: A computational framework for automated time-series phenotyping using massive feature extraction](http://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712%2817%2930438-6). _Cell Systems_ **5**, 527 \(2017\).
2. B.D. Fulcher, M.A. Little, N.S. Jones. [Highly comparative time-series analysis: the empirical structure of time series and their methods](http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/83/20130048.full). _J. Roy. Soc. Interface_ **10**, 20130048 \(2013\).

An updated list of papers related to _hctsa_, or using _hctsa_ is maintained on the _hctsa_ wiki [here](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa/wiki/Publications-using-hctsa).

An overview tutorial on applying _hctsa_ to a 5-class EEG dataset is [here](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsaTutorial_BonnEEG), and a recording of the tutorial \(final ~hour is a hands-on demo using this dataset\) is on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwPX3rWxP_Y).
