# Running Computations
<!--{#sec:calculating}-->

Specifying a set of time series, master operations, and operations generates a local `HCTSA_loc.mat` file (using `TS_init`).
This specification requires appropriately formatted [input files](input_files.md).
Once this is set up, computations are run using `TS_compute`.
