# Running Computations
<!--{#sec:calculating}-->

Specifying a set of time series, master operations, and operations generates a local `HCTSA.mat` file (using `TS_init`), as described [here](within_matlab.md).
Specifying these components of the *hctsa* analysis require formatted input files, described [here](input_files.md).
Once this is set up, computations are run using [`TS_compute`](running_computations.md).

These steps, as well as information on how to [inspect the results of an *hctsa* analysis](dealing_with_errors.md), are provided in this chapter.
