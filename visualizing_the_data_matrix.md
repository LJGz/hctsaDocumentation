# Visualizing the data matrix using `TSQ_plot_DataMatrix`
<!--{#sec:visualizing}-->

<!--There are many tasks that involve understanding the rich structure contained in data matrices by visualizing them.-->
<!--In this section we describe some basic tools we have developed to visualize the behavior of time series and operations in the data matrix.-->

<!--{#sec:visDatamatrix}-->

The clustered data matrix can be visualized by simply running

        TSQ_plot_DataMatrix()

[[mention how keywords can be used using the `TSQ_LabelGroups`]]
[[should include the data matrix visualization code, dimensionality
reduction code, and greedy feature selection code, as examples, each
with example workflows starting from retrieval from the database]]
[[mention how do similarity search, etc.]]
