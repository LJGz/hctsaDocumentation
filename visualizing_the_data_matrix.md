# Visualizing the data matrix
<!--{#sec:visualizing}-->

There are many tasks that involve understanding the rich structure contained in data matrices by visualizing them.
In this section we describe some basic tools we have developed to visualize the behavior of time series and operations in the data matrix.

### Visualizing the data matrix using `TSQ_plot_DataMatrix` {#sec:visDatamatrix}

    TSQ_plot_DataMatrix

[[mention how keywords can be used using the `TSQ_LabelGroups`]]
[[should include the data matrix visualization code, dimensionality
reduction code, and greedy feature selection code, as examples, each
with example workflows starting from retrieval from the database]]
[[mention how do similarity search, etc.]]
