# Visualizing the data matrix using `TSQ_plot_DataMatrix`
<!--{#sec:visualizing}-->

<!--There are many tasks that involve understanding the rich structure contained in data matrices by visualizing them.-->
<!--In this section we describe some basic tools we have developed to visualize the behavior of time series and operations in the data matrix.-->

<!--{#sec:visDatamatrix}-->

The clustered data matrix in **HCTSA_cl.mat** can be visualized by running

        TSQ_plot_DataMatrix('cl')

This will produce a colored visualization of the data matrix such as that shown below.
Visualizing the clustered matrix is the default behavior; but for some (large) datasets, reordering the rows and columns can be a time and computationally expensive task, in which case the normalized matrix can be plotted by instead specifying `TSQ_plot_DataMatrix('norm')`.

When data is grouped according to a set of distinct keywords and stored as group metadata in the **HCTSA_*.mat** files (using the `TSQ_LabelGroups` function), these can also be visualized using different colormaps by setting the second input to `1`, e.g., `TSQ_plot_DataMatrix('cl',1)`.
